A simple breaking news bar that monitors a chosen category and is displayed via a shortcode.

== Description ==

Breaking Bar is a simple plugin which monitors any chosen category for posts. If there are posts in that category,
the plugin displays (via the [breaking-bar] shortcode) a prominent bar with the latest post from that category.
If there are no posts in the chosen category, Breaking Bar stays hidden. Once the shortcode is in place, this allows
editors and authors to add posts to the Breaking Bar simply by properly categorizing the post.

Current options include:

* Category selection
* A text field for a custom label, (e.g. "Breaking" or "Latest")
* Color options for background, label(text) and link

To install this plugin:

1. Upload the `breaking-bar` directory to you plugins directory
